    "Traditional fraud detection solutions view data through a straw, focusing on discrete data points such as specific accounts, individuals, devices or IP addresses. However, today’s sophisticated fraudsters escape detection by forming fraud rings or curious loops composed of stolen and synthetic identities and circuitous back channels. To uncover such fraud rings, it is essential to look beyond individual data points in individual data sources to a broader view of the connection patterns between them that exist in multiple disparate data sources.\n",
    " \n",
    "ArangoDB’s multi-model graph allows you to easily fuse together disparate data and identify complex fraudulent patterns of connections, such as fraud rings, using the ArangoDB Query Language (AQL). The identification of fraud ring patterns require very deep (multi-hop) traversals across the graph.  The query for detecting a fraud ring can be accomplished in six lines of (easy to write and maintain) AQL code and ArangoDB can execute these queries with sub-second response times.\n",
